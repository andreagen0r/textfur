For now, I need a way to wait for user input.

This might need a QTimer, QKeyEvent, QEventLoop or a combination of all of those. I'm unaware which.

After that, gotta check how to implement input validation in athome.cpp.

Then check if Interface::getText() is needed in interface.cpp and athome.cpp.
